# Dharma-dwar
Dharma Dwar is an offline smart door access system that combines hand-gesture recognition and speech recognition for secure authentication. Using a camera and microphone, the door opens only when a closed fist is detected and the command “open the door” is spoken, then closes automatically after 5 seconds.
